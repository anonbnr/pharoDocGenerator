# Pharo Documentation Generator
This project is concerned with generating documentation for Pharo source code. It encapsulates an abstract documentation generator superclass `PharoDocGenerator` which factors all the common documentation generation state and behavior. It also allows for caching to improve performance. Finally, the identification of elements to document can be done by quering their objects or their corresponding symbols. The actual documentation generation has to be implemented in a corresponding documentation generator subclass, where the target documentation support is specified. Such supports include (_among others_) the basic `Transcript`, a **file**, a **web page**, **JSON**, **XML**, **CSV**, ... files. 

Furthermore, to allow the clients to flexibly choose the scope of elements to document, a trait is introduced for each element, encapsulating the documentation generation method (and potentially other pre-processing and post-processing methods). As such, the documentation generating subclasses can choose which elements they would like to target in their documentation generation process by using their corresponding traits in their definition.
